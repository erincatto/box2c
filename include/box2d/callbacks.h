/// Task interface
/// This is prototype for a Box2D task. Your task system is expected to invoke the Box2D task with these arguments.
/// The task spans a range of the parallel-for: [startIndex, endIndex)
/// The worker index must correctly identify each worker in the user thread pool, expected in [0, workerCount).
///	A worker must only exist on only one thread at a time and is analogous to the thread index.
/// The task context is the context pointer sent from Box2D when it is enqueued.
///	The startIndex and endIndex are expected in the range [0, itemCount) where itemCount is the argument to b2EnqueueTaskCallback
/// below. Box2D expects startIndex < endIndex and will execute a loop like this:
///
/// for (int i = startIndex; i < endIndex; ++i)

/// Returns a pointer to the user's task object. May be nullptr. A nullptr indicates to Box2D that the work was executed
///	serially within the callback and there is no need to call b2FinishTaskCallback.
///	The itemCount is the number of Box2D work items that are to be partitioned among workers by the user's task system.
///	This is essentially a parallel-for. The minRange parameter is a suggestion of the minimum number of items to assign
///	per worker to reduce overhead. For example, suppose the task is small and that itemCount is 16. A minRange of 8 suggests
///	that your task system should split the work items among just two workers, even if you have more available.
///	In general the range [startIndex, endIndex) send to b2TaskCallback should obey:
///	endIndex - startIndex >= minRange
///	The exception of course is when itemCount < minRange.
